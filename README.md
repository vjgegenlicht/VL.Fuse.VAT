# VL.Fuse.VAT
Extension including examples for Vertex Animation Textures (VAT) inside VL.Fuse 

Fuse is an open source library for visually programming on the GPU, built to enable rapid workflows and modular approaches to accelerated graphics, logic and computation. https://github.com/TheFuseLab/VL.Fuse 
It is built for use in vvvv gamma ( https://visualprogramming.net/ ) and follows its "always runtime" model allowing for fast design and programming work with no build or compile process in between you and your results.

Based on SideFX Houdini GameDevelopment Toolset: 
https://github.com/sideeffects/GameDevelopmentToolset/blob/Development/unity
using examples from keijiro's Unity implementation 
https://github.com/keijiro/HdrpVatExample 

The main goals for this package is to provide examples for the most common VAT and Pivot Painter implementations used by Unreal und Unity. 

The next steps:

1. Getting it to work with the Fuse PBR Pipeline
2. Create examples for Epics unreal tools  - Blender VAT Exporter Plugin https://github.com/JoshRBogart/unreal_tools
3. Various blender Pivot Painter Plugins
4. Unpack Normals from alpha
5. Clean up everything to a nice set of Fuse functions

 so youâ€™d somewhere on disk have:

\vl-libs\VL.MyHelpers\VL.MyHelpers.vl
and in args.txt you specify:

--package-repositories [path-to]\vl-libs
